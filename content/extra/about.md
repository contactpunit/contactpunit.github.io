Hi, this is my attempt to explain decorators well.Many beginners find decorators hard to understand and think decorators as some kind of black magic and never use them in thir python career. Tough there are ample books which deal with the topic, however the aim of this blog is to quickly get you started and give you confidence level to understand and use decorators as your coding practice. There are some complex use-cases which can be solved easily using decorators, so my advice is learning this tool.
