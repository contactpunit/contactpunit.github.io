Hello! Iâ€™m Punit Jain. I am a software enthusiast who loves reading and writing blogs on various software technologies.

I am mostly into tech and so, my blog will be a reflection of whatever new thing I learn about tech.

My native language is Python, however I can also understand Javascript. 

So this is what I think about learning a language.
 
You can spend 10 years writing a code in a language without understanding what is going on under the hood or
you get to learn first the 'advanced basics' of a language well and make better use of knowledge you gain in best possible way.

This is just the beginning of my attempt to unravel Python and Javascript language basics.

I hope my blogs help you clarify some doubts on a certain topic of your interest.

So I take this platform as a means to collaborate with you and to learn what I miss-understood on a topic, so do leave a comment about what you think about a topic.

Happy learning.
